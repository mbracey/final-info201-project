          global economy.
          Using World Bank data our analysis shows the economic state of each country
          and how this can effect different aspects of life.
          Using the data, we can show how GDP of a country can effect indicators 
          such as: female employment, life expectancy,
          military expenditure, refugee population, and gender equality in schools."),

          indicators of a country such like Schooling, Military, and Social Development. 
          To answer this question we used indicators from the World Bank that we 
          believe are a good indicator of how well developed a country is.
          By using side-by-side trend graphs we can show whether or not an increase or
          decrease in GDP overtime has any effect on these indicators. While the 
          relative wealth and success of a country goes beyond GDP, we aimed to show 
          that countries with high GDP typically have better scores in these certain 
          indicators.  For example, a country with a higher GDP such as the U.S.A has 
          little to no refugees, about equal gender parity in schooling, and a high 
          level of female unemployment. Conversely a country with a lower GDP such as 
          Chad has higher level of refugees fleeing to other countries, very 
          disadvantaged schooling, and low levels of female employment.
          While this depends on the country, there is generally a correlation between 
          high GDP and better performance in the indicators we used."),

          In order to analyze this question we provide a chloropleth map that shows 
          what percent of a country lives on either $1.09, $3.20, or $5.50 a day. 
          The global poverty threshold is $1.90 a day,
